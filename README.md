# Introduction to Deep Learning

The following material was used during the Data Mining course of the faculty of Statistics at University of Padua.

## Presentations

Into the repo `presentations/`, there are the slides used for presenting the lecture during the following conferences:
* 19<sup>th</sup> May 2017
* 11<sup>th</sup> May 2018
* 24<sup>th</sup> May 2019
* 22<sup>nd</sup> May 2020

## Notebooks

Into the repo `notebooks/`, there are 2 case studies for a beginnig approach to the deep learning. The notebooks are implemented in `R` programming language, using the `keras` package:
* **MNIST case study**: *image recognition* use case, solved using a *convolutional neural network*
* **IMDB case study**: *sentiment analysis* use case, solved using a *recurrent neural network*
