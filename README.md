# Introduction to Deep Learning

The following material was used during the Data Mining course of the faculty of Statistics at University of Padua.

Into this repository, there are 2 case studies for a beginning approach to the deep learning:
* **MNIST case study**: *image recognition* use case, solved using a *convolutional neural network*
* **IMDB case study**: *sentiment analysis* use case, solved using a *recurrent neural network*

The analyses are implemented in `R` programming language, using the `keras` library.

For each case study, you can find:
* An `R markdown` notebook, in *italian* language
* An `R` script, with just the code
